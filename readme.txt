AMAZON_SCRAPER.



I have done this project using Scrapy framework which crawls the amazon website for any given search term.

To run this project:
1.clone to your local repository.
2.install Scrapy:pip install Scrapy
3.Go to the spiders folder : cd amazondataset/amazondataset/spiders/
4.run command : scrapy crawl scraper -o output.csv
5.input the search term of the data you want to scrape from amazon.

#here the scraper is the name of the spider and it stores the result in csv file.
#one file is already present in the spiders directory...
